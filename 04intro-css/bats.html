  <h1>What are the best bats right now?</h1>  
    <h2>My personal favorite -3 BBCOR Bats (High School and College Level)</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>2-peice Hybrid Warstic Bonsaber</dt> 
    <dd>The Hybrid bonesaber is one of my favorite BBCOR bats, It has a light, balanced feel that isn't too end-loaded, and it has a lot of pop. It comes in a couple colors, like black, which is always a good look, then there is a off-white version that looks really nice, lastly there is a red,white,and blue ice pop version that looks great, and a yellow and pink sunset color scheme that is really nice looking. Overall, a very good bat for any type of player. </dd> 
    <dt>Easton Rope BBCOR</dt>
    <dd>The Easton Rope is another of my favorite BBCOR bats, it is a striking dark blue color and has a cool design on the barrel, it has pretty good pop and has good wear over time, it stays really good. My favorite thing about it is its sound, when you barrel one up with it, it sounds amazing, one of the best sounding bats i've used. The only thing I need to warn you about is it is much more end loaded, for a smaller player who dosen't necessarily a power hitter, it might be a bit difficult to swing. So, a pretty good bat for more of a heavy hitter type player.</dd>

    <h2>Some other amazing USSSA bats (this is anyone not in high school yet)</h2>
    <h3>USSSA One Peice  Marucci CatX -8</h3>
    <p> 
The -8 Marucci CatX is one of the most underrated bats ive used, it has amaxing pop and is super light and balanced, a quick swinging bat that hits like and end-loaded 2 peice. A clean white with red accents color scheme, it is one of my personal favorites.
    </p>    
    <h3>USSSA Easton Hypefire</h3> 
    <p>
   Do I even need to explain myself here? this very well might be the hottest bat of all time, it is another balanced two peice with an unexplainable ammount of pop. Its bright orange, yellow, and red color scheme matches it perfectly, along with and icy white and blue color scheme option as well. quite literally the hottest bat on the market right now.
